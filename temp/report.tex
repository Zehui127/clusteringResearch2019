This is a paragraph
This is another paragraph
This is one paragraph, not two paragraphs! Because, although I
used a carriage returnâ†µ
(pressed the Enter key) in the middle I didn't leave a blank
line. This is because this \LaTeX code specifies formatting,
and does not constitute formatting itself. i.e. \LaTeX is a
typesetting system and document markup language, unlike
Microsoft Word, Apple Pages or LibreOffice Writer which are
WYSIWYG Word Processors.
