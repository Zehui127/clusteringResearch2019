\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Clustering analysis can be defined as a process of segmenting the data points into several subsets, or clusters, with the goal of making the data points within a cluster to be similar to each other, while the data points in distinct clusters to be different. Clustering has been widely used in many fields, such as pattern recognition, bio-informatics and image processing, however, most of the study toward the uniform notion of clustering only stop at the very general level. The algorithms to achieve the clustering task are called clustering algorithm: depending on the definition of the clusters and the way to find the clusters, these clustering algorithms differ from each other significantly. In 2002, Kleinberg \cite{Kleinberg} published a highly influential paper, in which he set up a general framework for clustering algorithms as a whole, and proposed three properties that the clustering algorithms could have.
\newline

\noindent
Clustering algorithms fall into three categories \cite{esl}: combinatorial algorithms, mixture modelling, and model seeking, the algorithms in each category follows different underlying principal. The framework proposed by Kleinberg can be applied to all the clustering algorithm regardless of these principal. The core of the framework - three properties proposed by Kleinberg - are called scale invariance, richness and consistency respectively. Scale invariance states that if the distance(dissimilarity) between the data points is multiplied by a positive number, the clustering algorithm should partition the data into the same clusters as before. Richness requires that for any given partition of the data points, it will be possible to come up with a pair wise distance between the data points, so that the clustering algorithm can produce the given partition. Finally, a clustering algorithm is said to satisfy the consistency theorem if we perturb the data points in the following way: pair wise distances within a cluster are decreased, and pair wise distances between the cluster is increased, the algorithm should produce the same partition. The most important conclusion from Kleinberg's paper is that there is no clustering algorithm satisfying three properties at the same time.

\section{Raw data} \label{app:rawdata}

Material that needs to be included but would distract from the main
line of presentation can be put in appendices.
Examples of such material are raw
data, computing codes and details of calculations.
